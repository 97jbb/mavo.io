					"content": "Hooks are used as ways to execute custom code during various points of Mavo's execution. The name of the hook gives a summary of where the hook will be executed and usually follows the scheme `\"CLASS_NAME-METHOD_NAME-LOCATION\"`.\n\nSome examples:\n\n| Hook name | Executes | Definition |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `init-start` | At the start of the `Mavo` constructor, after a few properties have been initialized. | [mavo.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/mavo.js#L58) |\n| `node-init-start` | At the start of the `Mavo.Node` constructor, after a few properties have been initialized. | [node.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/node.js#L45) |\n| `group-init-start` | At the start of the `Mavo.Group` constructor, after its parent constructor (`Mavo.Node`) has been called. | [group.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/group.js#L11) |\n| `node-getdata-end` | Called right before `getData()` returns its value, to give plugins a chance to intercept and manipulate it. Note that a hook can be called multiple times in different places. | [collection.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/collection.js#L80) [group.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/group.js#L125) [primitive.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/primitive.js#L236) |\n\nNote: Links to the source code might not link to the exact hook definition as the code changes. Look a few lines above or below, it should be close.\n\n## Adding code to a hook\n\nYou can add a hook by calling `Mavo.hooks.add(\"hook-name\", callback)`. If you have multiple hooks, you can also pass an object, like so:\n\n```\n\n\t\t\tMavo.hooks.add({\n\t\t\t\t\"hook1-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t// hook 1 callback\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"hook2-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t// hook 2 callback\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t});\n\n```\n\nYou could also add code to hooks as one of the options in `Mavo.Plugins.register()`:\n\n```\n\n\t\t\tMavo.plugins.register(\"myplugin\", {\n\t\t\t\thooks: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"hook1-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// hook 1 callback\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"hook2-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// hook 2 callback\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t});\n\n```\n\nThe `env` object differs depending on the hook. For hooks run in instance methods of classes, `env` is an object that contains references to all important local variables so you can modify them in your plugin. If there are none, it just refers to the current instance. The context of the function (the `this` variable) is the current instance. This means that you could use a custom build of Mavo to experiment, then copy over your code to hooks without having to make changes to it.\n\n## Available hooks\n\nMavo calls `Mavo.hooks.run(\"hook-name\", data)` to run the code added at a hook. Therefore, you can [search Mavoâ€™s code for `Mavo.hooks.run(`](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Mavo.hooks.run%28&type=) and you will find all available hooks as well as where in the code they are executed.\n\nYou never need to run `Mavo.hooks.run()` yourself, unless you want to create hooks for your own plugin, i.e. allow other people to create plugins of your plugin (\"metaplugins\"? \"pluginception\"? ðŸ˜œ). In that case please prefix the hook names with your plugin id, to prevent collisions with other plugins.\n\n## Limitations\n\nHooks cannot change the return value of a function, unless the calling code has enabled that via a property on `env`. For example, in the `node-getdata-end` hook described above, all you need to do to change the return value is modify `env.data`.\n\nIn the future this may become possible, so avoid returning non-undefined values from your callbacks to make sure your plugin doesnâ€™t break when this is enabled.\n\n## Need a hook that doesnâ€™t exist yet?\n\n[Let us know](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/issues/new) and chances are weâ€™ll add it pretty soon. Make sure to describe what youâ€™re trying to do!"

When a Mavo allows login but the current user is not logged in, `mv-permissions` will include the value `login`. You can use this in your CSS to style things differently based on whether the current user is logged in.\n\nFor example, let's say you have an `auth` class and you want to only show anything with that class to authenticated users. You can do this with this CSS:\n\n```css\n\n\t\t[mv-permissions~=\"login\"] .auth {\n\t\t\tdisplay: none;\n\t\t}\n\n```\n\nNote the [`~=` in the attribute selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) above. This allows you to match for one value in a space-separated list, instead of the entire attribute.\n\nFor convenience, there are also `mv-logged-in` and `mv-logged-out` classes that you can use on your HTML to show things only to logged in or logged out users respectively."

					"id": "bar",

Itâ€™s typically specified on the Mavo root. Buttons are represented by their ids. You can find the ids of the built-in buttons below, but keep in mind that [Plugins](https://plugins.mavo.io) may add more:\n\n| id | Default? | Button |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| status | âœ“ | Displays currently logged in info for backends that support login |\n| edit | âœ“ | Edit button |\n| save | âœ“ | Save button |\n| import | | Upload a JSON file and override current data. |\n| export | | Download current data as a JSON file. |\n| login | âœ“ | Login button |\n| logout | âœ“ | Logout button |\n\nJust including a series of ids in the `mv-bar` attribute **restricts the toolbar to these buttons, in that order**.\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\n<div mv-app mv-storage=\"local\" mv-bar=\"import export edit save\">\n\t<div property=\"name\">Lea</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nHowever, often we only want to **add or remove a few buttons to the default set**. With the syntax above, we would need to remember all default ids and their default order in order to specify the buttons we want. This is why `mv-bar` also supports a **relative** syntax: by starting the value with `with` all values are interpreted as relative to the default set of buttons. You can then remove buttons by using a `no-` prefix and add buttons by just specifying their ids.\n\nNote that the edit button is still there, even though we didn't have to explicitly specify it.\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\n<div mv-app mv-storage=\"local\" mv-bar=\"with import export no-save\"> \n\t<div property=\"name\">Lea</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nNote: The `with` keyword can be omitted if thereâ€™s at least one `no-*`.\n\nTip: Want to **hide the Mavo bar from logged out users**? Use `mv-bar=\"no-login\"`. You can still log in without a Mavo toolbar, by adding `?login` to the page URL. Note that browsers often block popups more aggressively when they are not triggered by a click so you may need to manually approve the authentication popup when using this.\n\n# Hide the toolbar completely\n\nUse `mv-bar=\"none\"`. You can then use classes like `mv-status`, `mv-edit`, `mv-save`, `mv-clear`, `mv-login`, `mv-logout` etc on your own buttons to provide the corresponding functionality. However, note that if you choose to go this route, **these buttons will be always shown**, regardless of whether the user has permission for the corresponding action. You can use an `mv-permissions` attribute selector to fix this.\n\n# Change its placement and/or use your own HTML element for it\n\nJust use `class=\"mv-bar mv-ui\"` on your desired element.\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\n<div mv-app mv-storage=\"local\">\n\t<div class=\"mv-bar mv-ui\" style=\"background: blue\">\n\t\tYOLO\n\t</div>\n\t<div property=\"name\">Lea</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n# Remove default styling\n\nFollow the process above for using a custom toolbar element, and omit the `mv-ui` class:\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\n<div mv-app mv-storage=\"local\"> \n\t<div class=\"mv-bar\">YOLO</div> \n\t<div property=\"name\">Lea</div> \n</div>\n```\n\nThis is useful when you want a completely different styling and would rather start from a blank state. You can see a real example of custom toolbar styling on the [SVG Paths](/demos/svgpath) demo.\n\n# Custom button elements\n\nFollow the process above for using a custom toolbar element, and include your custom button inside it with the appropriate `mv-BUTTON_ID` class. For example, to have a Save button with the text \"Store\" instead of \"Save\", you could do:\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\n<div mv-app mv-storage=\"local\">\n\t<div class=\"mv-bar mv-ui\">\n\t\t<button class=\"mv-save\">Store</button>\n\t</div>\n\t<div property=\"name\">Lea</div>\n</div>\n```"

Please note that `lang` is not a Mavo attribute, itâ€™s an HTML attribute and its values are described in any HTML documentation.\n\nWarning: Please try to avoid locales with hyphens unless you absolutely need to. E.g. it's better to define a general French (`lang=\"fr\"`) locale and another Canadian French (QuÃ©bÃ©cois) locale (`lang=\"fr-ca\"`) with only the phrases that are different. The reason is that any French dialect can fall back to general French, but not to a specific dialect of French, which means that even if you have defined a locale for `fr-ca`, apps with `lang=\"fr\"` will be displayed in English.\n\nWarning: Please note that this datalist element is **static**, i.e. changes to its contents via scripts or expressions will not be picked up.\n\nFor a list of ids and phrases that you can copy as a starting point, use [src/locale.en.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/locale.en.js), however note that plugins can also define their own phrases.\n\n# Advanced: Customizing text via JavaScript\n\nYou can write your own localization plugin, by using `Mavo.Locale.register(languageCode, phrases)`. For an example, you can look at the [Greek localization plugin](https://plugins.mavo.io/locale-el/mavo-locale-el.js).\n\nIf you go that route, please consider adding your plugin to the [Plugins directory](https://plugins.mavo.io) so that others can benefit too!

To do that, we need the `mv-multiple` attribute, which tells mavo that **this element can be multiplied**:\n\n##### Example: Simple collection\n\n```html\nHobbies:\n<ul>\n\t<li property=\"hobby\" mv-multiple>Eating</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nNote: The `mv-multiple` attribute goes on **the element that will be multiplied, NOT the container of the collection**!\n\n* * *\n\nWe can use `property` and `mv-multiple` to create lists of more complex structures with multiple properties.\n\n##### Example: Complex collection\n\n```html\n<article property=\"pet\" mv-multiple>\n\t<h1 property=\"name\">Adam Catlace</h1>\n\tBorn on\n\t<time property=\"birthday\" datetime=\"2014-06-01\">1 Jun 2014</time>\n</article>\n```\n\nNote that in the example above, the `property` attribute on `<article>` does not actually make the entire `<article>` element editable, but instead acts as a **grouping element**. This will always happen when you use the `property` attribute on elements that contain other properties inside them. **Groups** have many interesting characteristics when combined with expressions, which we will see next.\n\n<p class=\"learn-more\">[Collections](/docs/collections)"

For those cases, you can do one of two things:\n\n*   Link to a form control via `mv-edit` _(recommended)_\n*   Nest a form control directly inside your property\n\nThe value of `mv-edit` is a CSS selector. If the CSS selector matches multiple elements on the page, the first one will be used. The element you linked to remains intact. Instead, it is cloned for the editing. If the original element changes (e.g. perhaps that's also populated by Mavo! It could even be an entirely separate Mavo app, like in [this demo](/demos/talks/)), a new clone is created.\n\nIn addition to using the element for editing, its default value also becomes the propertyâ€™s default value (unless `mv-default` is set of course).\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\nIâ€™m from\n<img src=\"/demos/talks/flags/[country].png\" />\n<span property=\"country\" mv-edit=\"#countries\"></span>\n\n<div hidden>\n\t<select id=\"countries\">\n\t\t<option value=\"gr\">Greece</option>\n\t\t<option value=\"gb\">United Kingdom</option>\n\t\t<option value=\"us\">United States</option>\n\t</select>\n</div>\n```"

You can take advantage of that and use `mv-default` to even keep properties in sync, like in the example below (for a real-world demo of this pattern, check out the [SVG Path builder](/demos/svgpath)):\n\n##### Example\n\nNote that changing the first number changes the second, until you edit the second and make it different:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"number\" property=\"x\" mv-default=\"5\" />\n<input type=\"number\" property=\"y\" mv-default=\"[x]\" />\n```"

Most of the time this works great, and you don't have to think about it. However, sometimes this heuristic will fail. In those cases, you can correct Mavo's prediction by using the `mv-attribute` attribute. Its value is either the name of the attribute that holds data, or `none` for no attribute (element contents).\n\nFor example, an `<a>` element's primary data attribute is `href`. However, sometimes you want to make the content editable instead, and even reference it in the `href` attribute via an expression. You can use the `mv-attribute` for that:\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\n<a href=\"mailto:[email]\" property=\"email\" mv-attribute=\"none\">lea@mavo.io</a>\n```"

If you use `mv-mode=\"read\"` or `mv-mode=\"edit\"` on a property, Mavo applies that state and does not change it when the state of the rest of the app changes. You can change it yourself, via expressions.\n\nThe latter allows many cool things:\n\n*   Use `mv-mode=\"read\"` to create \"constants\": Properties that are saved but not edited.\n*   Use `mv-mode=\"edit\"` for properties (or entire apps, if you use it on the Mavo root) that don't make sense in read mode.\n*   Use `mv-mode=\"[if (condition, read, edit)]\"` on collection items, to edit them separately from the rest of the app (useful with large collection items such as blog posts)"
