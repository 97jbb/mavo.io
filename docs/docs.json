					"id": "hooks",
					"title": "Hooks",
					"content": "Hooks are used as ways to execute custom code during various points of Mavo's execution. The name of the hook gives a summary of where the hook will be executed and usually follows the scheme `\"CLASS_NAME-METHOD_NAME-LOCATION\"`.\n\nSome examples:\n\n| Hook name | Executes | Definition |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `init-start` | At the start of the `Mavo` constructor, after a few properties have been initialized. | [mavo.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/mavo.js#L58) |\n| `node-init-start` | At the start of the `Mavo.Node` constructor, after a few properties have been initialized. | [node.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/node.js#L45) |\n| `group-init-start` | At the start of the `Mavo.Group` constructor, after its parent constructor (`Mavo.Node`) has been called. | [group.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/group.js#L11) |\n| `node-getdata-end` | Called right before `getData()` returns its value, to give plugins a chance to intercept and manipulate it. Note that a hook can be called multiple times in different places. | [collection.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/collection.js#L80) [group.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/group.js#L125) [primitive.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/primitive.js#L236) |\n\nNote: Links to the source code might not link to the exact hook definition as the code changes. Look a few lines above or below, it should be close.\n\n## Adding code to a hook\n\nYou can add a hook by calling `Mavo.hooks.add(\"hook-name\", callback)`. If you have multiple hooks, you can also pass an object, like so:\n\n```\n\n\t\t\tMavo.hooks.add({\n\t\t\t\t\"hook1-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t// hook 1 callback\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"hook2-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t// hook 2 callback\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t});\n\n```\n\nYou could also add code to hooks as one of the options in `Mavo.Plugins.register()`:\n\n```\n\n\t\t\tMavo.plugins.register(\"myplugin\", {\n\t\t\t\thooks: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"hook1-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// hook 1 callback\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"hook2-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// hook 2 callback\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t});\n\n```\n\nThe `env` object differs depending on the hook. For hooks run in instance methods of classes, `env` is an object that contains references to all important local variables so you can modify them in your plugin. If there are none, it just refers to the current instance. The context of the function (the `this` variable) is the current instance. This means that you could use a custom build of Mavo to experiment, then copy over your code to hooks without having to make changes to it.\n\n## Available hooks\n\nMavo calls `Mavo.hooks.run(\"hook-name\", data)` to run the code added at a hook. Therefore, you can [search Mavoâ€™s code for `Mavo.hooks.run(`](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Mavo.hooks.run%28&type=) and you will find all available hooks as well as where in the code they are executed.\n\nYou never need to run `Mavo.hooks.run()` yourself, unless you want to create hooks for your own plugin, i.e. allow other people to create plugins of your plugin (\"metaplugins\"? \"pluginception\"? ðŸ˜œ). In that case please prefix the hook names with your plugin id, to prevent collisions with other plugins.\n\n## Limitations\n\nHooks cannot change the return value of a function, unless the calling code has enabled that via a property on `env`. For example, in the `node-getdata-end` hook described above, all you need to do to change the return value is modify `env.data`.\n\nIn the future this may become possible, so avoid returning non-undefined values from your callbacks to make sure your plugin doesnâ€™t break when this is enabled.\n\n## Need a hook that doesnâ€™t exist yet?\n\n[Let us know](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/issues/new) and chances are weâ€™ll add it pretty soon. Make sure to describe what youâ€™re trying to do!"

You can find many style hooks in the [index](/docs).\n\nSome examples for common cases follow:\n\n## Style differently in edit mode\n\nGive an element with `property=\"foo\"` a yellow background when it is in edit mode:\n\n```css\n\n\t\t[property=\"foo\"][mv-mode=\"edit\"] {\n\t\t\tbackground: yellow;\n\t\t}\n\n```\n\n## Show something only to logged in users\n\n`mv-permissions` is an attribute set by Mavo on the Mavo root containing a space-separated list of available permissions. When a Mavo allows login but the current user is not logged in, `mv-permissions` will include the value `login`. You can use this in your CSS to style things differently based on whether the current user is logged in.\n\nFor example, let's say you have an `auth` class and you want to only show anything with that class to authenticated users. You can do this with this CSS:\n\n```css\n\n\t\t[mv-permissions~=\"login\"] .auth {\n\t\t\tdisplay: none;\n\t\t}\n\n```\n\nNote the [`~=` in the attribute selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) above. This allows you to match for one value in a space-separated list, instead of the entire attribute.\n\nFor convenience, there are also `mv-logged-in` and `mv-logged-out` classes that you can use on your HTML to show things only to logged in or logged out users respectively."

					"title": "Mavo toolbar",
					"content": "The Mavo toolbar is the dark toolbar that you get by default on every Mavo app, with controls like Edit, Save, Clear etc. By default it is added inside the Mavo root, at the beginning.\n\n## The mv-bar attribute: Remove buttons, enable optional buttons, change order, hide the toolbar\n\nThe `mv-bar` attribute controls which buttons are going to appear, if any. Itâ€™s typically specified on the Mavo root. Buttons are represented by their ids. You can find the ids of the built-in buttons below, but keep in mind that [Plugins](https://plugins.mavo.io) may add more:\n\n| id | Default? | Button |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| status | âœ“ | Displays currently logged in info for backends that support login |\n| edit | âœ“ | Edit button |\n| save | âœ“ | Save button |\n| import | Upload a JSON file and override current data. |\n| export | Download current data as a JSON file. |\n| login | âœ“ | Login button |\n| logout | âœ“ | Logout button |\n\nJust including a series of ids in the `mv-bar` attribute **restricts the toolbar to these buttons, in that order**.\n\n<h2 id=\"demo\" hidden></h2>\n\n```html\n<div mv-app mv-storage=\"local\" mv-bar=\"import export edit save\">\n\t<div property=\"name\">Lea</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nHowever, often we only want to **add or remove a few buttons to the default set**. With the syntax above, we would need to remember all default ids and their default order in order to specify the buttons we want. This is why `mv-bar` also supports a **relative** syntax: by starting the value with `with` all values are interpreted as relative to the default set of buttons. You can then remove buttons by using a `no-` prefix and add buttons by just specifying their ids.\n\nNote that the edit button is still there, even though we didn't have to explicitly specify it.\n\n<h2 id=\"demo\" hidden></h2>\n\n```html\n<div mv-app mv-storage=\"local\" mv-bar=\"with import export no-save\"> \n\t<div property=\"name\">Lea</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe `with` keyword can be omitted if thereâ€™s at least one `no-*`.\n\nWant to **hide the Mavo bar from logged out users**? Use `mv-bar=\"no-login\"`. You can still log in without a Mavo toolbar, by adding `?login` to the page URL. Note that browsers often block popups more aggressively when they are not triggered by a click so you may need to manually approve the authentication popup when using this.\n\n## Hide the toolbar completely\n\nUse `mv-bar=\"none\"`. You can then use classes like `mv-status`, `mv-edit`, `mv-save`, `mv-clear`, `mv-login`, `mv-logout` etc on your own buttons to provide the corresponding functionality. However, note that if you choose to go this route, **these buttons will be always shown**, regardless of whether the user has permission for the corresponding action. You can use an `mv-permissions` attribute selector to fix this.\n\n## Change its placement and/or use your own HTML element for it\n\nJust use `class=\"mv-bar mv-ui\"` on your desired element.\n\n<section class=\"example side-by-side\"><script type=\"text/plain\"><div mv-app mv-storage=\"local\"> <div class=\"mv-bar mv-ui\" style=\"background: blue\"> YOLO </div> <div property=\"name\">Lea</div> </div></script></section>\n\n## Remove default styling\n\nFollow the process above for using a custom toolbar element, and omit the `mv-ui` class:\n\n<section class=\"example side-by-side\"><script type=\"text/plain\"><div mv-app mv-storage=\"local\"> <div class=\"mv-bar\">YOLO</div> <div property=\"name\">Lea</div> </div></script></section>\n\nThis is useful when you want a completely different styling and would rather start from a blank state. You can see a real example of custom toolbar styling on the [SVG Paths](/demos/svgpath) demo.\n\n## Custom button elements\n\nFollow the process above for using a custom toolbar element, and include your custom button inside it with the appropriate `mv-BUTTON_ID` class. For example, to have a Save button with the text \"Store\" instead of \"Save\", you could do:"
