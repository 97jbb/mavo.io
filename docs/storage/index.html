<h2>Storage</h2>

<section>
	<p>
		The <code>data-store</code> attribute tells Mavo where any saved data will be stored.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Naming your application</h1>

	<p>
		It‚Äôs <strong>strongly recommended</strong> to name your application, for many reasons, such as storage, referring to properties in your Mavo from another Mavo, and many more.
		If you don't name your application, it will automatically get an id based on its index in the page, such as <code>mavo1</code>, <code>mavo2</code> etc.
		As you can imagine, this is flimsy: You don't want to lose your data if you just rearrange your Mavos in the page or add more Mavo-enabled pages in the same website!
		You can name your application via any of the following attributes.
		If more than one of the following are present, this is also the order they are checked in.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><code>data-mavo</code></li>
		<li><code>property</code></li>
		<li><code>itemprop</code></li>
		<li><code>id</code></li>
		<li><code>class</code> (Only the first class is used)</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Disabling storage</h1>

	<p>
		If your application does not need to store any data, you can use <code>data-store="none"</code>, or the <code>data-mavo</code> attribute with no <code>data-store</code> attribute.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Local storage</h1>

	<p>You can save your data in the browser‚Äôs <code>localStorage</code>, by using the keyword <code>local</code> as the value of the <code>data-store</code> attribute (<code>data-store="local"</code>).</p>

	<p>This can be useful if you are not planning to share your data with other people.
		Please note that most <code>localStorage</code> implementations have a limit of 4MB.
		Also, <code>localStorage</code> is bound by the same-origin policy. This means that if you change your URL, your data will be left behind!
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Github</h1>

	<p>
		Mavo will provide login controls and will not allow any edits until the viewer has logged in and has commit permissions.
		If the file and/or repo does not exist, Mavo will create it upon saving.
		The value of the `data-store` attribute can take almost any Github file URL, as well as some more fuzzy ones:
	</p>

	<dl>
		<dt><code>https://github.com/[username]</code></dt>
		<dd>This is perfect for people who want to use Github as a storage backend but are not familiar with it, since all it requires is signing up to get a username.
			Mavo will create a default repository of <em>mv-data</em> and will store data in a file called <em>[mavo-id].json</em></dd>

		<dt><code>https://github.com/[username]/[reponame]</code></dt>
		<dd>Mavo will create a file called [mavo id].json in that repository.</dd>

		<dt><code>https://github.com/[username]/[reponame]/[filename]</code></dt>
		<dd>Mavo will assume a default branch of <code>master</code></dd>

		<dt><code>https://github.com/[username]/[reponame]/blob/[branch]/[filename]</code></dt>
		<dd>The URL Github gives you when using its file browser. As specific as it gets, Mavo makes no assumptions.</dd>

		<dt><code>https://[username].github.io/[reponame]/[filename]</code></dt>
		<dd>Github Pages URL. Try to avoid these, as Mavo has to make some assumptions about what is the repo name, branch name, and filename, which could be wrong.</dd>

		<dt><code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[username]/[reponame]/[branch]/[filename]</code></dt>
		<dd>The URL that shows when you click the button <em>Raw</em> from the Github file browser.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p class="note">Note that <em>[filename]</em> above could include a path, e.g. <code>foo/bar/baz.json</code>.</p>
