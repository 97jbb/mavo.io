<h2>Writing Plugins</h2>

	<h1>Overview</h1>

	<p>Mavo was designed for extensibility from the beginning.
		There are both high level extensibility points for things that are most commonly extended (such as adding a new backend, or registering a new element type),
		but there are also <em>hooks</em> in strategic places, as low-level extensibility points that allow you to <strong>add your own code to Mavo’s internals</strong>.</p>
