Instead, we've been mostly using [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mavoweb) and the [Changelog](https://mavo.io/get/#releases) to announce new features and link to interesting Mavo-related resources. However, a blog is so much more. Besides new feature announcements, resources, and demos, we are hoping for this space to host tutorials and other learning resources that donâ€™t fit in the docs, solicit feedback, and in general be a two-way communication channel between our users and contributors.\n\nAfter all, a website about Mavo really **should** have a Mavo-powered blog, shouldnâ€™t it? ðŸ˜‰",
