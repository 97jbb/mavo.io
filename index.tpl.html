		<h1>Approachable</h1>
		<p>Mavo uses <strong>familiar HTML-based syntax</strong> and can be used even by people with no programming experience.
		This is not wishful thinking; <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2984551">it’s published, peer-reviewed research</a>.</p>
	</article>
	<article>
		<h1>Learnable</h1>
		<p>Mavo’s core functionality can be learned in <a href="docs">a few minutes</a>, and is enough to create a vast variety of applications that manage, store, and transform small-scale data.</p>
	</article>
	<article>
		<h1>Flexible</h1>
		<p>Design your application with the <strong>same design freedom and tools as a static webpage</strong>, whether that's a text-based editor or a visual one. Mavo works with your markup, not against it.</p>
	</article>
	<article>
		<h1>Extensible</h1>
		<p>Mavo has been designed for extensibility from the ground up. Plugins can modify almost every aspect of its behavior and add new powerful functionality.</p>
	</article>
	<article>
		<h1>Accessible</h1>
		<p>Mavo apps are keyboard accessible and screen reader friendly out of the box.</p>
	</article>
	<article>
		<h1>Free and Open Source</h1>
		<p>We created Mavo because we thought that creating Web applications should be easier than it is today. Monetization is not among our priorities.</p>
