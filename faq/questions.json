	"question": "Why are you not using data-* attributes?",
	"answer": "We love standards, and we struggled with this one a lot. Originally, Mavo was using `data-` attributes. However, we use a lot of attributes, so just using a `data-` prefix meant our attributes would likely collide with attributes from libraries that may be included on the same page or even `data-` attributes that the page author has defined for styling purposes. Also, if we are just using a `data-` prefix, it's not obvious which attributes are Mavo's and which ones are not. We _could_ use a `data-mv-` prefix, but that is very verbose and would make Mavo code harder to read since half of it would be the same attribute prefix repeated over and over. So, we chose `mv-` whose only drawback is theoretical purity: it causes absolutely no problems with anything, but as of right now, it will not pass HTML validation. [And even that may be changing](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2271).\n\n**We do support `data-mv-` versions of all our `mv-` attributes, but they are static**: they are converted to `mv-` attributes when Mavo starts and never read back. However, they work fine for most cases, and they can help you pass an HTML validator, if required.\n\nLastly, we designed Mavo to prototype a future where HTML can be used to create web applications. Our vision is that one day, some or all of its functionality will be supported natively by browsers, and then it's attribute prefix will certainly not be `data-`.",
